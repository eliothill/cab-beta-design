How to use it
=========

These guidelines are available for use but are in Alpha and subject to change. Styling is a mixture of css/scss, with additional features borrowed from Bootstrap. They will evolve over time based on user needs, testing, feedback and subsequent design patterns.


What they include
---------

The guidelines are based on an atomic design methodology (https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php) for building digital content. From this you can use the single atomic parts, contained in the '_modules' or combined with the molecules and organisms which are also included in '_partials'.


Templates
---------

Templates and pages are to follow, for more information, follow:
